    <h1>What is Open Source?</h1>
    <p>
      Open Source is a programming philosophy that work and ownership of
      projects should be decentralized and community-based. Open Source Software
      (OSS) is software which is publically visible and modifiable. Some OSS
      projects that you may know or have used include Mozilla Firefox, Linux,
      Audacity, and Wordpress.
